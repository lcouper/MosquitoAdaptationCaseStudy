# Mosquito Adaptation Case Study
R code for case study on Aedes aegypti-transmitted dengue in Northern Brazil

Parameters for R0(T) model came from: Mordecai et al. (2017). Detecting the impact of temperature on transmission of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya using mechanistic models. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases 11:e0005568.

Temperature data consisted of mean monthly air-surface temperature for 2021 and 2080 under RCP 8.5 using the HadGEM2-ES model. Data files ("tas_day_HadGEM2-ES_rcp85_r1i1p1_20201201-20251130.nc", "tas_day_HadGEM2-ES_rcp85_r1i1p1_20751201-20851130.nc") referenced in the R code were downloaded from the Earth System Grid Federation:
